##  Description

**Sidekick** runs as a personal AI co-worker powered by LangGraph. It uses Python agents defined in the codebase along with custom tools to perform workflows. Dependencies are managed via **uv**, maintaining reproducible environments and easy setup.

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ceodaniyal/Sidekick-Personal-Co-Worker.git
   cd Sidekick-Personal-Co-Worker
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv install
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   uv run python app.py
   ```

   This starts the workflow powered by LangGraph and controlled in `sidekick.py`.

## How It Works

* `app.py` — Serves as the main entry point for launching Sidekick.
* `sidekick.py` — Contains orchestration logic, coordinating workflows and agent actions.
* `sidekick_tools.py` — Defines reusable tools (APIs, helpers) that agents leverage during executions.

---

## Customize Your Sidekick

* **Add or modify tools** in `sidekick_tools.py` for specialized tasks.
* **Update orchestration logic** in `sidekick.py` to adjust agent coordination.
* **Expand `app.py`** to support different entry points or use cases.

## Why Use Sidekick?

Sidekick offers a structured, modular foundation to build multi-agent AI tools via LangGraph, with modern Python setup. Quick to set up and flexible to extend, it's a solid starting point for tailored AI assistance workflows.
